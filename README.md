# Quotes API (Template provided by Codecademy)

This simple API, created with NodeJS, was a personal project, which I made due to the education program on Codecademy.
I learned the syntax of Node and what it is capable of. 

## How to use the API

Since it is a really simple project, the API is not that complicated to use at all. You can just clone the repository and start listening on ```localhost```.
There you can show quotes from different creators or show all quotes that are saved in ```data.js```which represents an array that holds the quotes.

You can also add new quotes and authors. 

I am planning on updating the API with other functionality since it is a nice exercise to really grasp all the capability and the easy syntax of noce.
Functionality a plan to add in the near future: 

- PUT route for updating quotes in the data
- DELETE route for deleting quotes from the data array
- other data to the array, such as the year of each quote, and displaying it on the front-end
- another resource, such as biographical blurbs
- realizing all of the above with Express Routers to keep the code clean and separated into different files for each router
